Task 1: Tower of Hanoi Solver

Create a program that solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for n disks.

The solution should use recursion to move disks between three

pegs (source, auxiliary, and destination) according to the game's rules.

The program should print out each move required to solve the puzzle.
