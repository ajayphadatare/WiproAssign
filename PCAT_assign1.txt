Pseudocode Development - Task: Write a detailed pseudocode for a simple program that takes a number as input, calculates the square if it's even or the cube if it's odd, and then outputs the result. Incorporate conditional and looping constructs.
 
 
-Take input value from a user
-Read input number.
-Then check a user enterd value is even number or odd number.
-check input number is even
         (checking even number - input_number%2 == 0)
          if number is even
         -calculate the square of the input number.
             square = input_number * input_number
         -output -> square number.
                ------   
                  or
                ------
           else 
               number is odd
         -calculate the cube of the input number
             cube = input_number * input_number * input_number
         -output -> cube
